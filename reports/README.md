# Reports – shared cross-agent folder

This folder is the central place where all agents (Cursor/Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity/Gemini, others in the future) should write Markdown reports.

Typical examples:
- Infrastructure investigations and audits
- Schema / database change analysis
- Data-flow and connection checks
- Phase summaries for the `web-test` project

Each report should be a standalone `.md` file with a clear Task/CLI ID in its filename.
