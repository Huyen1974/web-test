# WEB-41: Auto-Approval Test Report

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Agent:** Claude Code CLI (Opus 4.5)
**Test Discussion ID:** 6

---

## Test Parameters

- **Topic:** [TEST] Kiem tra Auto-Approval 5 Phut
- **Initial Status:** pending_human
- **Created At:** 2026-02-01T13:38:50Z

---

## Test Results

### Status After Flow Triggered
- **Final Status:** reviewing
- **Human Comment:** [AUTO-APPROVED: Discussion auto-advanced after timeout]

### Flow Behavior
The Directus Flow "AI Discussion Auto-Approval Timer" triggered successfully.

**Note:** The flow executes the auto-approval logic immediately rather than waiting 5 minutes. This is because Directus Flows do not have a native "sleep" or delayed execution operation.

### For True 5-Minute Delay
To implement actual 5-minute delay, would need:
1. Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler
2. External webhook service with delayed trigger
3. Cron job checking pending_human discussions

---

## Verification

```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "status": "reviewing",
  "human_comment": "[AUTO-APPROVED: Discussion auto-advanced after timeout]"
}
```

---

## Result: PARTIAL PASS

- Flow logic: WORKING
- Auto-approval trigger: WORKING
- 5-minute delay: NOT IMPLEMENTED (requires external scheduler)
